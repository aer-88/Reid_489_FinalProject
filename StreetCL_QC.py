Steps from VB Script:
- set data types
- set error messages

Functions:
- Open File 
- Write File: takes a file path (strPath) and an array of strings (strFileData) as parameters. that writes an array of strings to a text. file The file is then closed.
- SortStrArray: takes an array of strings (strArray) as a parameter. It sorts the elements of the strArray in ascending order using a simple bubble sort algorithm. The sorted array is modified in place.
- SortRFArray: takes an array of custom data structures (udtArray) called StrtData as a parameter. It sorts the elements of the udtArray based on the intRF_Add ("Right From Address") field of each StrtData structure. The sorting is done in ascending order using a bubble sort algorithm.
- NoDup: removes duplicates from a string array.
- isEven: checks if an integer value is even.

- Run: performs a series of operations using the data from the file.
1. The code starts with the declaration of variables that will be used throughout the subroutine. These variables include strFile, strWFile, strWriteFile, udtFile, strStreets, udtCurStrt, udtErrStrt, udtTempStrt, and several counter variables (i, j, k, e).
2. The user is prompted to input the path and file name of the input text file (strFile) and the output text file (strWFile).
3. The OpenFile function is called, passing the strFile variable as an argument. This function reads the contents of the input text file and returns an array of StrtData structures (udtFile).
4. The code initializes an array (strStreets) to store unique street names extracted from the udtFile array.
5. A loop iterates through each element in the udtFile array, excluding the header row. If the address of the street segment is greater than 0, the street name is added to the strStreets array.
6. The SortStrArray function is called to sort the strStreets array in alphabetical order.
7. The NoDup function is called to remove duplicate street names from the strStreets array.
8. Another loop iterates through each street name in the strStreets array.
9. Inside this loop, a new array (udtCurStrt) is initialized to store all the street segments for the current street.
10. Another loop iterates through the udtFile array to collect each segment for the current street.
11. The SortRFArray function is called to sort the udtCurStrt array by the "Right From" address.
12. If there is more than one street segment in the udtCurStrt array, the code proceeds to check for errors.
13. A temporary street segment (udtTempStrt) is initialized to store the last street segment for comparison.
14. Another loop iterates through all the street segments in the udtCurStrt array and compares them for three types of errors: Flow, Overlap, and Gap.
15. If a flow error is detected (i.e., the flow of addresses is inconsistent between segments), the error details are added to the udtErrStrt array.
16. If an overlap error is detected (i.e., the address ranges of segments overlap), the error details are added to the udtErrStrt array.
17. The code includes commented-out code for checking gap errors (i.e., address gaps between segments), but it is currently disabled.
18. After checking all the street segments, the code builds an output text array (strWriteFile) that will be written to the output text file.
19. The error details from the udtErrStrt array are added to the strWriteFile array.
20. Finally, the WriteFile function is called to write the contents of the strWriteFile array to the output text file specified by strWFile.
